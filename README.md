# 💬 Raspberry Pi Speech Interaction Project

## 📋 Project Overview
This project aims to create an interactive speech-to-text and text-to-speech system on a Raspberry Pi. The system will listen to spoken words via a microphone, convert the speech to text, translate the text to a different language, and then articulate the translation back to the user using a text-to-speech engine.

## 💽 Hardware Requirements
- Raspberry Pi (Model 3B+ or later recommended for better performance)
- Microphone compatible with Raspberry Pi
- Speakers or headphones compatible with Raspberry Pi

## 👨🏼‍💻 Software Requirements
- Raspbian OS (Latest version recommended)
- Python 3.7
- SpeechRecognition library for Python
- Googletrans library for translation
- gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech) library for Python

## 💻 Installation

### Setting Up the Hardware
